In 2025, the game's singleplayer source code was released under a [special license](LICENSE.md) that prohibits commercial use but is completely open for the game's community, education and research.
Please review the terms of the [license agreement](LICENSE.md) carefully before using it.

# What is in this repository
- `Data` - game data
- `Soft` and `Tools` - development tools
- `Versions` - compiled versions of the game, including map editors
- `Sources` - source code and tools

# Preparation

All libraries from the SDK directory are needed for compilation. The paths to them must be entered in **Tools => Options => Directories** in the following order:

## Include
```
C:\SDK\BINK (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\FMOD\API\INC (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\S3TC
C:\SDK\STINGRAY STUDIO 2002\INCLUDE\TOOLKIT (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\STINGRAY STUDIO 2002\INCLUDE (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\STINGRAY STUDIO 2002\REGEX\INCLUDE (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\Maya4.0\include
```

## Lib
```
C:\SDK\BINK (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\FMOD\API\LIB (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\S3TC
C:\SDK\STINGRAY STUDIO 2002\LIB (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\STINGRAY STUDIO 2002\REGEX\LIB (not included in the repository)
C:\SDK\Maya4.0\lib
```

In addition, **DirectX 8.1** or higher is required (it will automatically be added to the paths).

### Important Notes

- **Bink, FMOD, Stingray** libraries are not included in this repository as they require separate licensing.
- **stlport** *must* be located in the Visual C directory, alongside `include`.
- The path `C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO\VC98\STLPORT` must be **first**, otherwise, the build will fail.

---

# Additional Tools

- The **tools** directory contains utilities used during the build process.
- Resources are stored in **zip (deflate)** format and are packed/unpacked using **zip/unzip**.
- **Do not use pkzip** — it truncates file names and does not use the deflate algorithm.
- Some data is edited manually using an **XML-editor**, as frequent editing was not necessary and writing a separate editor was impractical.

---

# Files in `data`

In the game's directory, under **data**, there are files that are manually edited or simply placed:

- `sin.arr` — binary file with a sine table (just place it, do not touch).
- `objects.xml` — registry of game objects (edited manually).
- `consts.xml` — game constants for designers (edited manually).
- `MusicSettings.xml` — music settings (edited manually).
- `partys.xml` — country data (which squad to use for gun crew, parachutist model, etc.).

## Files in `medals`

In the **medals** subdirectory, files `ranks.xml` contain ranks and **experience** needed to obtain them, organized by country.
