qr_querycallback_t
-------------------
This is the prototype for the callback functions your game needs to
implement for each of the four basic query types. The callback works the
same for each query type. 

[outbuf] is a pre-allocated buffer for you to place the query reply. It's size is
[maxlen] (default is 1400). If you need larger, you can adjust the 
	defines in gqueryreporting.c
[userdata] is the pointer that was passed into qr_init. You can use this for an
	object or structure pointer if needed.

Simply fill outbuf with the correct data for the query type (consult the sample
apps and the GameSpy Developer Spec). 
outbuf should be a NULL terminated ANSI string.

qr_t
----
This abstract type is used to instantiate multiple instances of the
Query & Reporting SDK (for example, if you are running multiple servers
in the same process).
For most games, you can ignore this value and pass NULL in to all functions
that require it. A single global instance will be used, similar to how the
original Developer SDK worked

QR_INIT
--------
This creates/binds the sockets needed for heartbeats and queries/replies.
[qrec] if not null, will be filled with the qr_t instance for this server.
	If you are not using more than one instance of the Query & Reporting SDK you
	can pass in NULL for this value.
[ip] is an optional parameter that determines which dotted IP address to bind to on
	a multi-homed machine. You can pass NULL to bind to all IP addresses.
[baseport] is the port to accept queries on. If baseport is not available, the
	Query and Reporting SDK will scan for an available port in the range of 
	baseport -> baseport + NUM_PORTS_TO_TRY
	Optionally, you can pass in 0 to have a port chosen automatically
	(makes it harder for debugging/testing).
[gamename] is the unique gamename that you were given
[secretkey] is your unique secret key
[qr_*_callback] are your data callback functions, this cannot be NULL
[userdata] is an optional, implementation specific parameter that will be
	passed to all callback functions. Use it to store an object or structure

/************
QR_INIT_SOCKET
--------
This version of qr_init allows the game to specify the UDP socket to use for
sending heartbeats and query replies. This enables the game and the QR SDK to
share a single UDP socket for all networking, which can make hosting games
behind a NAT proxy possible (see the documentation for more information).
You must also use qr_parse_query to pass in any data received for the QR SDK
on the socket, since the SDK will not try to read any data off the socket directly.
[qrec] if not null, will be filled with the qr_t instance for this server.
	If you are not using more than one instance of the Query & Reporting SDK you
	can pass in NULL for this value.
[s] is the UDP socket to use for heartbeats and query replies. It must be a valid
	socket and should be bound to a port before calling qr_init_socket. It can be
	blocking or non-blocking.
[gamename] is the unique gamename that you were given
[secretkey] is your unique secret key
[qr_*_callback] are your data callback functions, this cannot be NULL
[userdata] is an optional, implementation specific parameter that will be
	passed to all callback functions. Use it to store an object or structure
	pointer if needed.

/*******************
QR_PROCESS_QUERIES
-------------------
This function should be called somewhere in your main program loop to
process any pending server queries and send a heartbeat if 5 minutes has
elapsed.

Query replies are very latency sensative, so you should make sure this
function is called at least every 100ms while your game is in progress.
The function has very low overhead and should not cause any performance
problems.
Unless you are using multiple instances of the SDK, you should pass NULL
for qrec.
The no_heartbeat version will not send any heartbeats to the master - use
this if you only want to advertise your server on the LAN.

/*******************
QR_PARSE_QUERY
-------------------
Use only with qr_init_socket to pass in data that is destined for the Q&R SDK
from your game socket. 
You still need to call qr_process_queries in your main loop, and just call this
function whenever data is received. 
Unless you are using multiple instances of the SDK, you should pass NULL
for qrec.
Query is the string of query data received from the client. It -MUST- be
a NULL terminated string, so make sure you terminate the string before passing
it into this function, since it will not be terminated when read off the socket.
len is the length of the query string, not including the NULL termination.
Sender is the address that the query is received from. The QR SDK will reply
directly to that address using the socket provided in qr_init_socket.
*******************/

/*****************
QR_SEND_STATECHANGED
--------------------
This function forces a \statechanged\ heartbeat to be sent immediately.
Use it any time you have changed the gamestate of your game to signal the
master to update your status.
Unless you are using multiple instances of the SDK, you should pass NULL
for qrec.
*******************/
void qr_send_statechanged(qr_t qrec);

/*****************
QR_SEND_EXITING
--------------------
This function forces a \statechanged\2 heartbeat to be sent immediately.
Use it any time you have changed the gamestate of your game to signal the
master to update your status.
Use this before your game exits by changing the gamestate to "exiting"
and sending a statechanged heartbeat. This will insure that your game
is removed from the list promptly.
Unless you are using multiple instances of the SDK, you should pass NULL
for qrec.
*******************/
void qr_send_exiting(qr_t qrec);


/*****************
QR_SHUTDOWN
------------
This function closes the sockets created in qr_init and takes care of
any misc. cleanup. You should try to call it when before exiting the server
if qr_init was called.
If you pass in a qrec that was returned from qr_init, all resources associated
with that qrec will be freed. If you passed NULL into qr_int, you can pass
NULL in here as well.
