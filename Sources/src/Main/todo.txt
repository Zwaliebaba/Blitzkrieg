* GFX
	- shader - contains references to textures, matrices, and other constants. Can be swapped/changed via RS/TSS/VS/PS
	- should be able to group shaders into MIP-like levels to simplify or enhance effects and control placement/capabilities

* Optimization
	- remove multiple area maps from the scene and keep only static objects, dynamic objects, and units
	- when rendering terrain, first build a large buffer and then draw it using temporary vertices/indices. If the terrain doesn't change for several frames, create a static buffer for it
	- for rivers and 3D roads — break them into strips
	- when generating particles along a path/field, optimize the distance/position calculation

* Startup & API Checks
	- maintain a list of "required" modules and validate it after all loading completes
	- implement a "checker" for modules that verifies the presence of the required API
